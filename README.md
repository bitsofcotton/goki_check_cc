# Goki Check
These program aims to get prepared model geometry in A still image in a deterministic way.  
Please refer older information at https://sourceforge.net/p/gokicheck/wiki/Home/ .

# How to use
Please touch Makefile for Eigen and stdc++ enabled.  
This program needs ascii raw ppm files to input/output.  
To convert image files to raw ppm, it is powerful tool that imagemagick with 'convert from.image -compress none to.ppm'. 

# Parameters
* fisheye.hh
* * z_max  : z-index resolution.
* * stp    : number of points to be used in detecting edges.
* * thresh : edgepoint colour difference threshold.
* * vbox.  : size of vector gathering rectangle.
* * rz     : z-axis output ratio.
* tilt.hh
* * z_ratio : [0,1] to [0,z_atio].
* scancontext.hh
* * matchPartialPartial::ndiv    : number of divides that match angles, effects the matching errors.
* * matchPartialPartial::threshp : ratio of threshold for matched points.
* * matchPartialPartial::threshs : ratio of threshold for operator ==.

# Context
This program is inspired from re-focus photo softwares.  
And around this, there's many preceders that many approach to get bump maps with certain conditions
(such as multiple camera conditions, or, with layered objects, or, spherical, or, from movie, etcetc).
There's a defocus photo algorithms http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.2308&rep=rep1&type=pdf some words with googled. So it's accurate for most cameras, goki_check_cc is standing on another hypothesis that is not widely  used (in another words, some transform or special camera is needed for photos...).  
There's preceders to match 3D to 2D with many approaches. (s.t. detecting topology of junction point, or, machine learning, and so on.). And it is fater than this that PnP problem and specific point based matching.

# How to use as library (sample code).
Please refer tools.cc, and please include with namespace directive (but include guard definition should harms).

# Demos
https://services.limpid-intensity.info/ have a sample interface working demos.
Please bookmark output directory page after sending images, then please wait some minutes.  
N.B. a file per 5 minutes, up to 20 Mo total upload size.

# Tips
These program's enlarge is based on pseudo DFT half space plausible one. Already configured.  
These program's collect is based on DFT differential. No need to configure.  
These program's bump assumes F=âˆž graphics. Please configure the parameters before to use.   
These program's match matches with calculated pseudo z-depth, please configure in pseudoBump class initializer.  
These program's match3d assumes input file as a bump map and .obj 3d file.  
These program's match assumes one of vertices is full and another is lowPoly but now, it isn't.

# Specification
PseudoBump generates the bumpmap that is pseudo plausible one because of one image condition and hypothesis, but this is correct if the hypothesis, if it's in the focal point, edge is better clear than other places, is correct.  
Pseudo condition is avoidable on very wide cases with multiple camera conditions,
if it fails, the image resolution or color depth resolution lacks, or, something like different colours with each angle like mirrors, or, because of scattering or fog things.
