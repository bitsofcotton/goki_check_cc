# Goki Check
These program aims to get prepared model geometry in A still image in a deterministic way.  
Please refer older information at https://sourceforge.net/p/gokicheck/wiki/Home/ .

# How to use
Please touch Makefile for stdc++ enabled.  
This program needs ascii raw ppm files to input/output.  
To convert image files to raw ppm, it is powerful tool that https://www.imagemagick.org/ with 'convert from.image -compress none to.ppm'.   
For speed, http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/ library is needed, and for bone information, https://github.com/jessey-git/fx-gltf/ library is needed.

# Parameters
* redig.hh
* * vbox : size of vector gathering rectangle.
* * rz   : z-axis output ratio.
* scancontext.hh
* * matchPartialPartial::ndiv    : number of divides that match angles, effects the matching errors.
* * matchPartialPartial::threshp : ratio of threshold for matched points.
* * matchPartialPartial::threshs : ratio of threshold for operator ==.

# Context
This program is inspired from re-focus photo softwares.  
And around this, there's many preceders that many approach to get bump maps with certain conditions
(such as multiple camera conditions, or, with layered objects, or, spherical, or, from movie, etcetc).
There's a defocus photo algorithms http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.2308&rep=rep1&type=pdf some words with googled. So it's accurate for most cameras, goki_check_cc is standing on another hypothesis that is not widely used (in another words, some transform or special camera is needed for photos...).  
There's preceders to match 3D to 2D with many approaches. (s.t. detecting topology of junction point, or, machine learning, and so on.). And it is fater than this that PnP problem and specific point based matching.  
By searching with some word that is not common, there exists the article https://ryo620.org/2018/02/to-gltf-from-fbx-by-blender/ that I firstly know the gltf format by this.

# How to use as library (sample code).
Please refer tools.cc, and please include with namespace directive (but include guard definition should harms).

# Demos
https://services.limpid-intensity.info/ have a sample interface working demos.
Please bookmark output directory page after sending images, then please wait some minutes.  
N.B. a file per 5 minutes, up to 20 Mo total upload size.

# Tips
These program's enlarge is based on pseudo DFT half space plausible one.  
These program's collect is based on DFT differential.  
These program's bump assumes F=âˆž graphics.  
These program's match matches with calculated pseudo z-depth, please configure in reDig class initializer.  
These program's match assumes one of vertices is full and another is lowPoly but now, it isn't.

# Specification
enlarger2ex generates the bumpmap that is pseudo plausible one because of one image condition and hypothesis, but this is correct if the hypothesis, if it's in the focal point, edge is better clear than other places, is correct.  
Pseudo condition is avoidable on very wide cases with multiple camera conditions,
if it fails, the image resolution or color depth resolution lacks, or, something like different colours with each angle like mirrors, or, because of scattering or fog things.

And, generated bumpmap is flat enough in global, (this might be corrected by summing up per scale conversions), so this causes match fails because of thin shapes. If you don't like such results, please try pbump command.
